Projects including one individual project and 3 group projects. All these projects are finished by Python.

The individual project is about Computation of inter-event time and analyzing the CMS Nursing Home Dataset. The first group project is about Clustering, such as using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters; evaluating the performance of the clustering algorithm using external and internal validation metrics and so on. The second group project is about Time Series Analysis and Forecasting. The 1st task is about applying NVG and HVG to the data set and generating scatter plots. The 2nd task is about building forecasting models using using ES and ARIMA models and comparing these two models using forecast evaluation metrics. The last project is about word frequency analysis, such as demonstrating Zipf’s law by plotting log-log plots of word frequencies vs rank for each year and using TF-IDF to calculate and show the 5 most “important” words for each year.
